# Read Me for CS 250: Software Development Cycle

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
To interpret user needs, it's helpful to sit down with select users and ask questions about their opinions of the product. Once you've asked questions, you can create user stories based off the answer provided. User stories provide a great template for product development.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
I approach the development of programs by first creating a template, whether that be pseudocode or a flow chart. Then I create the components that I listed, and dive in from there. I hope to incorporate daily scrums and user story development into my future development work.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
To be a good team member in software development, it's important to be professional. When working in a professional environment, it's good to hold yourself at a high standard. Along with holding yourself at a high standard, it's important to be helpful towards your team members and keep open communication with the team.
